# Breadcrumbs
Breadcrumbs are a navigation component that helps users understand their current location within a website or application.

### Note for Developers
Breadcrumbs Component works on the pattern that the last Breadcrumb is your current page, and therefore should not have an href attribute. This will also keep the last Breadcrumb from rendering a carrot seperation icon.

### Children
Breadcrumbs component will accept `Breadcrumb` component as a child. It will accept a [collection](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/collections.html) which can be either static or dynamic.

### Static Collection
```jsx
<Breadcrumbs>
  <Breadcrumb href="/">Timmy</Breadcrumb>
  <Breadcrumb href="/">Django</Breadcrumb>
  <Breadcrumb>Spark</Breadcrumb>
</Breadcrumbs>
```

### Dynamic Collection
```jsx
import type {Key} from 'react-aria-components';

function Example() {
  let [breadcrumbs, setBreadcrumbs] = React.useState([
    {id: 1, label: 'Timmy', href: '#timmy'},
    {id: 2, label: 'Django', href: '#django'},
    {id: 3, label: 'Spark'}
  ]);

  // Example of how to manage navigation. You may use other methods provided by the router.
  let navigate = (id: Key) => {
    let i = breadcrumbs.findIndex(item => item.id === id);
    setBreadcrumbs(breadcrumbs.slice(0, i + 1));
  };

  return (
    <Breadcrumbs items={breadcrumbs} onAction={navigate} />
  );
}
```

### Using with a router
Breadcrumbs component is built with Stitch Link component. This component will work with a router if a provider is set up in your app. [Instructions can be read here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/routing.html).

Further information on how to intergrate with a router [can be found here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/Breadcrumbs.html#content).
